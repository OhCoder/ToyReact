## This is a toy react project, just for learning react source code.
#### The project demo is based on the [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) demo [Tic Tac Toe](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR).

### Usage
#### Install
```
npm i
```

#### Play the game
Open the *dist/main.html* file with Chrome.

#### Modify toy react source code
every time you changed the source code(like *main.js*, *toy-react.js*), you can run
```
npx webpack
```
to update the *dist/main.js* file, then refresh Chrome manually, you can see the new change on the browser.

#### Happy coding, :)
